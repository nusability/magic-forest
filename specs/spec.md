<!--
  THE ONE SPEC
  ============
  This file is the single specification of the whole game, AS IT IS NOW. It is never copied
  per feature. /speckit-specify adds a feature as a new `### F-NNN` block under "Features",
  or amends an existing one in place.

  Versioning: none. Git is the version (`git log -- specs/`). No changelog, no
  "Last updated", no Spec-Version.

  Stage (constitution, "Stages"): prototype | pre-prod | live. Only the owner changes it.
    prototype  web/ only. Keep this file LIGHT: Vision, Core Loop, the numbers play proved.
    pre-prod   iOS + Android in parallel. Full F-NNN sections; behaviour change = spec change
               in the same commit; platform-delta table enforced.
    live       As pre-prod, and player data is sacred (Player Data section is mandatory).

  ID rules (global across the file, NEVER reused or renumbered):
    F-001 features · US1 user stories · FR-001 functional reqs · NFR-001 global reqs ·
    SC-001 success criteria. Take the next ID from the "Next IDs" line and bump it.
    A removed item is deleted (git keeps it); its ID stays retired.

  Describe WHAT the player experiences and WHY. Engines, libraries and code structure belong
  in specs/plan.md and decisions/, never here. Future work belongs on Stori, never here.

## Vision

A magic, colorful bird, seen from behind, flies through the air and trails sparkles and
stars. Wherever they touch the ground, a magic forest grows. Its plants and trees grow the way
living things do: trunks extend, branches fork, leaves unfurl, buds swell, and glowing blossoms
open. Nothing simply scales up. The forest is the reward, and watching it spread behind you
should be beautiful in its own right.

Each level asks the player to grow the forest to a set size. Along the way they keep making
one choice: detour to collect amplifiers and multipliers that make their sparkles grow more,
faster, or wider, or keep sowing the ground below. The feeling to aim for is calm,
generous wonder, with a quiet thread of smart decisions running through it.

**Elevator pitch**: Fly a magic bird whose sparkles grow a glowing forest branch by branch, and choose when to chase power-ups to grow it to the level's goal.

**Target player**: {{WHO, WHEN, HOW LONG PER SESSION}}

## Core Game Loop

1. {{STEP}}
2. {{STEP}}
3. {{STEP}}

**Win / lose / end**: {{HOW A RUN, MATCH OR LEVEL ENDS}}

## Tuned Numbers

<!-- In prototype: the constants that survived play in web/, with what each one controls.
     From pre-prod on, these move into the F-NNN sections and into shared/data/, and this
     section lists only the cross-cutting ones. -->

| Name | Value | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| {{name}} | {{value}} | {{effect}} |

## Platforms & Scope

<!-- prototype: "web/ prototype only." pre-prod onward: fill in the list below. -->

- **iOS**: iPhone, {{portrait/landscape}}, minimum iOS {{N}}.
- **Android**: phone, {{portrait/landscape}}, minimum API {{N}}.
- **Out of scope**: {{e.g. tablets, landscape, web as a store target}}.
- **Business model**: {{premium / free-to-play with IAP}}, bound by the constitution's
  monetization ethics. Nothing is sold until this spec says what is sold.
- **Reference devices**: flagship {{iPhone X / Pixel Y}}; low end {{device}}, the weakest
  we support.

### Platform deltas

The complete list of places where iOS and Android do not agree. **A difference that is not in
this table is a bug** on whichever platform is wrong. Each row is dated, and is either
**permanent** (a decision, backed by an ADR) or **temporary** (a schedule fact that names the
Stori item closing it). The goal for temporary rows is zero.

| Since | Kind | Behind / differs | Delta | Closed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Features

<!--
  One block per feature. Priority is per user story (P1 = needed for the first playable
  build). Each user story must be independently playable/testable.
-->

### F-001: {{Feature Name}}

**Summary**: {{What this feature adds and why it matters to the player}}

#### US1 – {{Title}} (P1)

{{The player journey in plain language.}}

**Independent test**: {{How this is played/tested on its own}}

**Acceptance scenarios**:

1. **Given** {{state}}, **When** {{player action}}, **Then** {{outcome}}

#### Requirements (F-001)

- **FR-001**: The game MUST {{capability}}

#### Edge cases (F-001)

- {{Rotation, backgrounding, a call coming in, interrupted touch, low storage, no network…}}

---

## Global Requirements

<!-- Whole-game, player-facing, measurable. Start filling these at pre-prod. -->

- **Performance**: {{60 fps on the flagship reference device; ≥ 30 fps and no input hitches on
  the low-end reference device; cold start to playable ≤ N s}}
- **Interruptions**: {{auto-pause on background, call or notification; clean resume}}
- **Input & layout**: {{touch targets ≥ 44 pt / 48 dp; safe areas; one-hand reach}}
- **Accessibility**: {{text scaling range; Reduce Motion honoured; nothing by colour alone;
  VoiceOver/TalkBack labels}}
- **Audio**: {{respects silent switch / media volume; mute remembered}}
- **Localisation**: {{languages; chosen by the device}}

## Player Data

<!-- Mandatory from `live`. What is saved, where, and the migration promise. -->

- **Saved**: {{progress, settings, balances, entitlements}}
- **Where**: {{on device only / cloud backup}}
- **Promise**: in `pre-prod` saves may reset. In `live` every change to a saved shape ships
  a migration, and a record that fails to decode is preserved.

## Telemetry

<!-- Every event that leaves the device, when it fires, and what it carries. Empty means none. -->

| Event | Fires when | Carries |
|---|---|---|

## Golden Vectors

<!-- From pre-prod: which parts of the simulation are pinned by shared/vectors/, and what
     re-recording a vector requires (a spec diff explaining why). -->

## Key Entities

- **{{Entity}}**: {{what it represents, key attributes}}

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: {{measurable, technology-agnostic outcome}}

## Assumptions

- {{assumption}}

## Out of Scope

- {{deliberately excluded}}

## Clarifications

<!-- Appended by /speckit-clarify. Remove a session once its answers are folded in above
     and committed, because git keeps the record. -->
